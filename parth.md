# Analyse complexity of bubble sort

The space complexity for Bubble Sort is O(1), because only a single additional memory space is required i.e. for temp variable.

Also, the best case time complexity will be O(n), it is when the list is already sorted.

Following are the Time and Space complexity for the Bubble Sort algorithm.

<ul>
<li>Worst Case Time Complexity [ Big-O ]: O(n2)
<li>Best Case Time Complexity [Big-omega]: O(n)
<li>Average Time Complexity [Big-theta]: O(n2)
<li>Space Complexity: O(1)
