# Analyse complexity of selection sort

Selection sort is a sorting algorithm in computer science. It has O(n²) time complexity. O(n²) isn’t a good time complexity for sorting lists when it comes to large input sizes.

<ul>
<li>Worst Case Time Complexity is: O(N2)
<li>Average Case Time Complexity is: O(N2)
<li>Best Case Time Complexity is: O(N2)
<li>Space Complexity: O(1)
